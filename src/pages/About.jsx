              Electrify was founded in 2010 as a humble electrical supplies
              store in Bengaluru, Karnataka. Over the years, our passion for
              customer satisfaction and quality products has allowed us to
              expand into new areas, offer a broader range of solutions, and now
              serve both residential and commercial clients across the region.
              <br />
              <br />
              From day one, our mission has remained the same: to light up lives
              and power dreams.
